## **Objective:**

Refactor the following Lua code to make it faster and more responsive, with a focus on event-driven operations like button presses and component state changes.

**Guidelines for Refactoring:**

1. **Use Class-Based Architecture (OOP):**
    - Implement all Lua scripts using class-based architecture with metatable patterns.
    - Prefer metatable-based class construction (as used by UCIController) for multiple instances and inheritance.
    - Avoid closure-based patterns in favor of object-oriented approaches.
    - Structure scripts as classes with proper initialization, methods, and state management.
    - Use consistent naming conventions: `ClassName` for class names, `instanceName` for instances.

2. **Streamline Event Handlers:**
    - Make event handlers (e.g., button press callbacks) as direct and minimal as possible.
    - Update UI and system state immediately within the event handler.
    - Avoid unnecessary function calls or nested callbacks.

3. **Reduce Redundant Component Access:**
    - Access component properties directly where safe (e.g., `component.property = value`).
    - Use error-trapping functions (like `safeComponentAccess`) only for operations that genuinely need error handling.
    - Minimize the number of function calls for routine property assignments.

4. **Batch and Parallelize Initialization:**
    - Group initialization steps to reduce the number of sequential delays and timers.
    - Use a single timer for all delayed initialization tasks where possible.

5. **Eliminate Redundant State and UI Updates:**
    - Consolidate state and UI updates so each change happens only once per event.
    - Avoid updating the same property or state multiple times in a single operation.

6. **Simplify and Modularize Logic:**
    - Break down complex logic into clear, single-responsibility functions.
    - Minimize code duplication.
    - Keep the call stack shallow for event-driven code.

7. **Direct Routing and State Management:**
    - Perform routing assignments and visual feedback directly in the event handler.
    - Avoid indirect calls for critical, time-sensitive operations.

8. **Profile and Target Real Bottlenecks:**
    - Focus optimizations on the most critical, high-frequency operations (e.g., button presses, routing changes).
    - Avoid unnecessary micro-optimizations in non-critical paths.

9. **Maintain Readability and Maintainability:**
    - Keep code modular and well-organized.
    - Use clear comments and consistent naming conventions.

10. **Prefer Combo Boxes for Component Selection:**
    - Where users need to select between multiple components (e.g., devices, channels, options), use Combo Boxes (dropdowns) instead of multiple buttons or manual entry.
    - Ensure Combo Box selections trigger immediate, efficient updates to the UI and system state.
    - Only use Combo Boxes where it improves clarity, reduces UI clutter, or streamlines selection logic.

11. **Dynamically Pull Component Types:**
    - Use `Component.GetComponents()` to dynamically retrieve available component types. Run through all components in one loop.
    - Populate Combo Boxes or selection lists with the results of `Component.GetComponents()` to ensure the UI always reflects the current system state.
    - Avoid hard-coding component types; always use dynamic queries for flexibility and maintainability.
